Chatty App
=====================

A REACT based chat app!

### Usage

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Users can change their name in the chat by typing in their desired name in the bottom left input field and pressing ENTER.

1 of 4 colours is automatically chosen as the user connects to the server.

Multiple users can connect and a live counter is displayed at the top right to show how many users are currently in the chat.

If a user adds an image/gif url to their message the image/gif will be displayed.
